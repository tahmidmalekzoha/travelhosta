# Featured Guides Implementation

## Overview

Added functionality to select and feature exactly 4 guides on the homepage from the existing guides. Admins can manage featured guides through a dedicated admin panel interface.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Updated GuidesContext** (`contexts/GuidesContext.tsx`)

Added featured guides management to the existing context:

#### New State

- `featuredGuideIds: number[]` - Array of IDs for featured guides
- Default: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (first 4 guides)

#### New Methods

- `setFeaturedGuides(ids: number[])` - Set featured guide IDs (max 4)
- `getFeaturedGuides()` - Get the featured guide objects

#### Features

- Persists featured guide IDs to localStorage (`travelhosta_featured_guides`)
- Automatically removes deleted guides from featured list
- Ensures maximum of 4 featured guides
- Loads featured guides on app initialization

### 2. **Featured Guides Admin Page** (`app/admin/featured/page.tsx`)

- New admin route: `/admin/featured`
- Dedicated page for managing featured guides

### 3. **FeaturedGuidesManagement Component** (`components/admin/FeaturedGuidesManagement.tsx`)

Beautiful admin interface with the following features:

#### Current Featured Section

- Displays the 4 currently featured guides
- Shows guide image, title, division, and category
- Grid layout (1/2/4 columns on mobile/tablet/desktop)

#### Selection Area

- Search functionality to filter guides
- Grid of all available guides (clickable cards)
- Visual selection indicator (checkmark badge)
- Selected count display (X/4)
- Color-coded borders for selected guides

#### Controls

- **Save Changes** button (only enabled when exactly 4 guides selected)
- **Reset** button to discard changes
- Buttons only appear when changes are made
- Confirmation alerts for save operations

#### User Experience

- Click any guide card to select/deselect
- Maximum 4 guides can be selected
- Alert if trying to select more than 4
- Search filters guides by title, division, or category
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 4. **Updated Components**

#### **AdminSidebar** (`components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`)

- Added "Featured Guides" navigation link with Star icon
- Positioned between "Guides" and "Categories"

#### **HomePage** (`components/HomePage.tsx`)

- Removed hardcoded `GUIDES_DATA.slice(0, 4)`
- Now uses `getFeaturedGuides()` from GuidesContext
- Dynamically displays admin-selected featured guides
- Section title remains "Featured Travel Guides"

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**

   - Featured guide IDs load from localStorage or default to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - HomePage fetches featured guides using `getFeaturedGuides()`
   - Displays matching guide objects

2. **Admin Selection**

   - Admin navigates to `/admin/featured`
   - Clicks guide cards to select/deselect (max 4)
   - Clicks "Save Changes" when exactly 4 are selected
   - Featured guide IDs saved to localStorage
   - Context updates trigger re-render on homepage

3. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - If a featured guide is deleted, it's automatically removed from featured list
   - Context ensures featured list stays valid

### User Experience - Admin

1. Sign in to admin panel
2. Navigate to `/admin/featured` (or click "Featured Guides" in sidebar)
3. View current 4 featured guides at top
4. Scroll through all available guides below
5. Click guides to select (green border + checkmark) or deselect
6. Monitor count display (must be 4/4)
7. Click "Save Changes" when ready
8. Changes immediately reflected on homepage

### User Experience - Website Visitors

1. Visit homepage
2. Scroll to "Featured Travel Guides" section
3. See the 4 guides selected by admin
4. Click "View" on any guide to navigate to guides page
5. Featured guides update when admin changes selection
