2. **Attributes Go in Brackets**: Optional attributes like titles go in square brackets

   ```
   :::timeline [title="My Timeline"]
   ```

3. **Separate Images with Dashes**: In galleries, use `---` between images

4. **Check the Stats**: At the bottom of the editor, you'll see:

   - Total number of blocks
   - Count of each block type
   - Helps ensure your content is balanced

5. **Fix Errors Before Saving**: Red error messages will show if something is wrong

## Best Practices

### Content Structure

1. **Start with Text**: Begin with an introduction text block
2. **Use Multiple Timelines**: Break multi-day trips into separate timeline blocks
3. **Add Context Between Sections**: Use text blocks to provide transitions
4. **Include Visual Breaks**: Insert images between long sections
5. **End with Summary**: Close with tips or conclusion text block

### Image Guidelines

1. **Use High-Quality Images**: At least 1920x1080 for full-width images
2. **Always Add Captions**: Help users understand what they're seeing
3. **Include Alt Text**: Makes content accessible
4. **Use Galleries for Multiple Views**: Don't create separate blocks for related photos
5. **Optimize Images**: Compress images before uploading to external hosts

### Timeline Organization

1. **One Day Per Timeline**: Separate each day into its own timeline block
2. **Clear Step Titles**: Use location names or time periods
3. **Include All Costs**: List all expenses for budgeting
4. **Add Time Estimates**: Help travelers plan their schedule
5. **Provide Alternatives**: Mention different transport options

### Writing Style

1. **Be Conversational**: Write like you're talking to a friend
2. **Use Formatting**: **Bold** important info, _italicize_ for emphasis
3. **Break Up Text**: Keep paragraphs short and scannable
4. **Include Tips**: Share insider knowledge
5. **Be Specific**: Exact costs, times, and locations

## Migration from Old Format

If you have existing guides with the old itinerary-only format, they will continue to work! The system automatically detects and displays legacy content.

To upgrade an old guide:

1. Edit the guide in the admin panel
2. The old itinerary will be displayed in the new editor
3. Add text blocks, images, or galleries around the timeline
4. Save the guide - it now uses the enhanced format

## Technical Details

### Data Structure

Guides now have a `content` field containing an array of content blocks:

```typescript
interface GuideData {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  division: string;
  category: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  content?: ContentBlock[]; // New flexible format
  itinerary?: ItineraryStep[]; // Legacy support
}
```

### Block Types

```typescript
type ContentBlockType = "text" | "timeline" | "image" | "imageGallery";
```

Each block type has its own interface with specific properties.

### Parser

The content parser (`contentParser.ts`) handles:

- Converting text format to structured blocks
- Converting blocks back to text for editing
- Validation of content structure
- Error reporting

### Renderer

The content renderer (`ContentRenderer.tsx`) provides:

- Consistent styling across block types
- Responsive layouts
- Accessibility features
- Smooth animations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**"No itinerary steps found"**

- Make sure timeline blocks have at least one `## Step Title`

**"Title is required"**

- Each timeline step needs a title starting with `##`

**"URL is required"**

- Image and gallery blocks must have a `url:` field

**"Content is required"**

- Text blocks cannot be empty

### Syntax Issues

**Block not parsing:**

- Check that you have both opening `:::type` and closing `:::`
- Ensure no extra spaces in the opening tag
- Verify correct block type spelling

**Attributes not working:**

- Attributes must be in square brackets `[title="My Title"]`
- Use quotes around attribute values
- Only use supported attributes (title, heading)

**Gallery images not separating:**

- Use exactly three dashes `---` between images
- No spaces around the dashes
- Each image section must have a `url:` field
