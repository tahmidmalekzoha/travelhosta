# Table Feature Documentation

## Overview

The table feature allows you to create structured, professional-looking tables in your travel guides. Tables are perfect for:

- **Price comparisons** (Budget vs Mid-Range vs Luxury)
- **Itinerary schedules** (Time, Activity, Cost)
- **Packing lists** (Item, Quantity, Notes)
- **Transportation options** (Mode, Duration, Cost)
- **Accommodation comparisons** (Hotel, Location, Price, Rating)

## Two Ways to Create Tables

### Method 1: Visual Table Editor (Recommended)

The visual table editor provides a WYSIWYG interface for creating tables.

**Steps:**

1. Click the **"Table (Visual Editor)"** button (purple button with table icon)
2. A modal will open with:
   - **Title field** (optional) - Main heading for your table
   - **Caption field** (optional) - Description below the table
   - **Visual table editor** - Edit cells directly
   - **Live preview** - See how it will look

**Editor Features:**

- ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit cells** - Click any cell to edit content
- ‚ûï **Add columns** - Click "+ Column" button
- ‚ûï **Add rows** - Click "+ Row" button
- üóëÔ∏è **Delete columns** - Click trash icon on column header
- üóëÔ∏è **Delete rows** - Click trash icon on row
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è **Move columns** - Use arrow buttons to reorder
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è **Move rows** - Use arrow buttons to reorder
- üëÅÔ∏è **Live preview** - See final appearance at bottom

**Tips:**

- Start with default 3 columns, 2 rows - add/remove as needed
- Headers are automatically styled with dark background
- Use clear, concise text in cells
- Keep column widths balanced (avoid very long text in one cell)

### Method 2: Text Syntax

You can also write tables directly using pipe-separated syntax.

**Syntax:**

```
:::table [title="Your Title" caption="Your Caption"]
Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3
---
Row 1, Cell 1 | Row 1, Cell 2 | Row 1, Cell 3
Row 2, Cell 1 | Row 2, Cell 2 | Row 2, Cell 3
:::
```

**Rules:**

- Headers on first line, separated by `|`
- Separator line `---` after headers
- Data rows, each cell separated by `|`
- Title and caption are optional
- Spaces around `|` are trimmed automatically

## Examples

### Example 1: Price Comparison Table

```
:::table [title="Accommodation Options" caption="Prices per night in Taka"]
Hotel | Location | Budget | Mid-Range | Luxury

Grand Plaza | Business District | N/A | 3000 | 5000
Hilltop Resort | Outskirts | 1000 | 2500 | 4500
:::

## Styling Features

### Automatic Styling

The table renderer applies professional styling automatically:

- Dark background (#1b3c44)
- White text
- Bold font
- Padding for readability
- Borders between columns

**Data Rows:**

- Alternating colors (white and light gray)
- Hover effect (changes to beige #f2eee9)
- Borders between cells
- Proper padding

**Overall:**

- Rounded corners
- Shadow effect
- Responsive (scrolls horizontally on mobile)
- White background
- Professional appearance

### Responsive Design

- On desktop: Full table width, all columns visible
- On tablet: Horizontal scroll if needed
- On mobile: Full horizontal scroll for wide tables
- Always readable and accessible

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

1. **Keep Headers Short**

   - ‚úÖ Good: "Duration", "Cost", "Time"
   - ‚ùå Avoid: "How long it takes to complete", "The total amount in Taka"

2. **Consistent Data Format**

   - ‚úÖ All prices in same currency (Taka)
   - ‚úÖ Same units (hours, not mix of hours/minutes)
   - ‚úÖ Similar detail level across rows

3. **Use Alignment**

   - Numbers naturally align right
   - Text aligns left
   - Keep consistent for scannability

4. **Limit Columns**

   - Ideal: 3-5 columns
   - Maximum: 6-7 columns
   - More columns = harder to read on mobile

5. **Appropriate Row Count**
   - Minimum: 2 data rows (after header)
   - Ideal: 3-8 rows
   - Maximum: 12-15 rows (consider splitting into multiple tables)

### Design Tips

1. **Add Context**

   - Use title to explain the table's purpose
   - Use caption to add important notes
   - Place related text block before/after table

2. **Strategic Placement**

   - Tables work well after descriptive text
   - Group related tables together
   - Don't start a guide with a table

3. **Combine with Other Blocks**

   ```
   :::text [heading="Accommodation Guide"]
   Sylhet offers various accommodation options for every budget.
   Here's a comprehensive comparison to help you choose:
   :::

   :::table [title="Hotels Comparison"]
   [Your table here]
   :::

   :::text
   All hotels listed above are in safe areas with good access
   to transportation and attractions.
   :::
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem: Columns don't align**

- **Cause**: Different number of cells in rows
- **Solution**: Ensure all rows have same number of cells as headers

**Problem: Table too wide on mobile**

- **Cause**: Too many columns or long text
- **Solution**: Reduce columns, shorten text, or split into two tables

**Problem: Empty cells show nothing**

- **Cause**: Cells are truly empty
- **Solution**: Add "N/A", "-", or "TBD" for clarity

**Problem: Table not parsing**

- **Cause**: Missing `:::` markers or `---` separator
- **Solution**: Check syntax, use visual editor to generate correct format

### Validation Errors

**"At least one header column is required"**

- Add headers on first line

**"At least one data row is required"**

- Add at least one row after the `---` separator

**"Column count mismatch"**

- Ensure all rows have same number of `|` separators
- Each row should have same columns as header

## Tips for Content Creators

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 3 columns, 3 rows. Expand as needed.

2. **Use Visual Editor**: Much easier than writing syntax manually.

3. **Preview Often**: Click "Show Preview" to see how table looks.

4. **Test on Mobile**: Tables should be readable on phones.

5. **Be Consistent**: Use similar tables throughout your guide for consistency.

6. **Add Context**: Always explain what the table shows (title/text).

7. **Update Regularly**: Keep prices and information current.

8. **Consider Alternatives**: Sometimes a list or text is clearer than a table.
