- Improved parameter documentation with `@param` tags
- Added warning for unknown block types
- Simplified attribute parsing logic

## Performance Improvements

### React Optimization Hooks Used:

1. **useMemo**

   - Featured guides calculation
   - Filtered guides
   - Has changes detection
   - Background styles
   - Image validation
   - Context values

2. **useCallback**
   - Event handlers (onClick, onChange)
   - Context methods (addGuide, updateGuide, deleteGuide)
   - Navigation handlers
   - Form handlers

**Impact:** Reduces unnecessary re-renders and recalculations, especially important for lists and context providers.

- Added proper TypeScript interfaces
- Used `Metadata` type for Next.js metadata
- Proper function return types

### 2. Constants Extraction

- Theme colors

- Configuration values

### 3. Helper Functions

- Image validation
- Guide filtering
- Storage operations
- ID comparison

### 4. Documentation

- JSDoc comments for all components
- Parameter descriptions
- Return type documentation
- Usage examples

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**

   - Each function has one clear purpose
   - Utilities separated from components

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

   - Shared utilities for common operations
   - Reusable ImagePlaceholder component
   - Centralized constants

3. **Separation of Concerns**

   - Business logic in contexts
   - UI logic in components
   - Utilities in separate files

4. **Performance Optimization**

   - Memoization where appropriate
   - Callback optimization
   - Reduced unnecessary renders

5. **Maintainability**
   - Clear function names
   - Comprehensive comments
   - Logical file organization

---

## Testing Recommendations

To verify that behavior remained unchanged:

1. **Visual Testing**

   - Compare UI before/after on all pages
   - Test responsive layouts
   - Verify image placeholders display correctly

2. **Functional Testing**

   - Test guide CRUD operations
   - Verify featured guides selection
   - Test search and filtering
   - Verify localStorage persistence

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders (React DevTools)
   - Verify memoization is working
   - Test with large numbers of guides

---

## Files Not Modified

The following files were intentionally not modified as they were already well-structured:

- Card1.tsx, Card2.tsx, Card3.tsx, Card4.tsx (simple, clean components)
- FAQSection.tsx (uses CSS modules, good structure)
- Timeline.tsx (well-documented, clean implementation)
- Small page components (admin pages that just render other components)

---

## Conclusion

All refactoring changes focused on improving code quality without changing functionality. The application should:

- Look exactly the same
- Behave exactly the same
- Perform better due to optimizations
- Be easier to maintain and extend
- Have better documentation

**No breaking changes were introduced.**
